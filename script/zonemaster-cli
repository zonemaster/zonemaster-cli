=head1 NAME

zonemaster-cli - run Zonemaster tests from the command line

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    zonemaster-cli [--help | --version | --list-tests]
    zonemaster-cli [OPTIONS] --dump-profile
    zonemaster-cli [OPTIONS] DOMAINNAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<zonemaster-cli> is a command-line interface to the L<Zonemaster> test engine.
It takes instructions the user provides as command line arguments, transforms
them into suitable API calls to the engine, runs the test suite and prints the
resulting messages. By default, the messages will be translated by the engine's
translation module, with the corresponding timestamp and logging level when
printed. See the available options below.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 Special Options

=over 4

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print brief usage information and exit.
(run `man zonemaster-cli` for the full manual page)

=item B<--version>

Print version information and exit.

=for :man The printed version numbers are the versions of this program as well as the ones from the underlying
L<Zonemaster> test engine.

=item B<--list-tests>

Print all test cases listed in the test modules, then exit.

=item B<--dump-profile>

Print the effective profile used in JSON format, then exit.

=back

=head2 Testing Options

=over 4

=item B<--test>=TESTCASE, B<--test>=TESTMODULE

Limit the testing suite to run only the specified tests.
(default: the empty string)

=begin :man

EXPR is an expression specifying or modifying the set of tests to run.
Here are some examples:

=over 4

=item --test=all

runs all defined test cases including any test cases 
disabled by the profile.

=item --test=B<nameserver>

runs the entire Nameserver test module, and nothing else.

=item --test=B<nameserver01>

runs the Nameserver01 test case, and nothing else.

=item --test=B<dnssec-dnssec05>

runs the entire DNSSEC test module except the DNSSEC05 test case, and nothing
else.

=item --test=B<all-nameserver+nameserver03>

runs all test cases of all test modules except for the Nameserver test module in
which only the Nameserver03 test case is run.

=item --test=B<-dnssec>

removes all test cases of the DNSSEC module from the set of tests that would
otherwise have run.

=item --test=B<+syntax01+syntax02>

adds the Syntax01 and Syntax02 test cases to the set of tests that would
otherwise have run.

=item --test=

(i.e., the empty string) leaves the set of tests to run unmodified.

=back

=end :man

=item B<--level>=LEVEL

Specify the minimum level of a message to be printed.
(default: NOTICE)

=for :man Messages with this level
(or higher) will be printed. The levels are, from highest to lowest:
CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG, DEBUG2 and DEBUG3.
The lowest three levels (DEBUG) add a significant amount of messages to be shown.
They reveal some of the internal workings of the test engine, and are probably
not useful for most users.

=begin :man

=item B<--stop-level>=LEVEL

Specify the minimum severity level after which the testing suite is terminated.
(default: the empty string)

=for :man When set to the empty string, testing is allowed to complete normally
no matter what messages are emitted.

=for :man The levels are, from highest to lowest: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE,
INFO, DEBUG, DEBUG2 and DEBUG3.

=end :man

=item B<--[no-]progress>

Print an activity indicator ("spinner").
(default: enabled if the process' standard output is a TTY)

=for :man Useful to know that something is happening during a run.

=item B<--[no-]ipv4>, B<--[no-]ipv6>

Enable or disable queries over IPv4 or IPv6.
(default: both enabled)

=begin :man

=item B<--sourceaddr4>=IPADDR, B<--sourceaddr6>=IPADDR

Set IPv4 or IPv6 source address for DNS queries.

=for :man Setting an address not correctly configured on a local network interface
fails silently.

=end :man

=item B<--profile>=FILE

Override the Zonemaster Engine default profile data with values from
the given profile JSON file.

=back

=head2 Formatting Options

=over 4

=item B<--[no-]json>

Print results as JSON instead of human language.
(default: disabled)

=begin :man

=item B<--[no-]json-stream>

Stream the results as JSON.
(default: disabled)

=for :man Useful to follow the progress in a machine-readable way.

=item B<--[no-]raw>

Print messages as raw dumps (message identifiers) instead of translating them
to human language.

=end :man

=item B<--locale>=LOCALE

Specify which locale to be used by the translation system.
(default: system locale or English)

=for :man If not given, the
translation system itself will look at environment variables to try and guess.
If the requested translation does not exist, it will fallback to the local
locale, and if that doesn't exist either, to English.

=begin :man

=item B<--[no-]time>

Print the timestamp for each message.
(default: enabled)

=item B<--[no-]show-level>

Print the severity level for each message.
(default: enabled)

=item B<--[no-]show-module>

Print the name of the module which produced the message.
(default: disabled)

=item B<--[no-]show-testcase>

Print the name of the test case (test case identifier) which produced the message.
(default: disabled)

=end :man

=back

=begin :man

=head2 Summary Options

=over 4

=item B<--[no-]count>

Print a summary, at the end of a run, of the numbers of messages for each severity
level that were logged during the run.
(default: disabled)

=item B<--[no-]nstimes>

Print a summary, at the end of a run, of the times (in milliseconds) the zone's
name servers took to answer.
(default: disabled)

=item B<--[no-]elapsed>

Print elapsed time (in seconds) at end of a run.
(default: disabled)

=back

=head2 Undelegated Test Options

=over 4

=item B<--ns>=DOMAINNAME, B<--ns>=DOMAINNAME/IPADDR

Provide information about a nameserver, for undelegated tests.

=for :man The argument
must be either: (i) a domain name and an IP address, separated by a single
slash character (/), or (ii) only a domain name, in which case a A and AAAA
records lookup for that name is done in the live global DNS tree (unless
overridden by --hints) and from which the results of that lookup will be used.

=for :man This switch can be given multiple times. As long as any of these switches
are present, their aggregated content will be used as the
entirety of the parent-side delegation information.

=item B<--ds>=KEYTAG,ALGORITHM,TYPE,DIGEST

Provide a DS record for undelegated testing (that is, a test where the
delegating nameserver information is given via --ns switches).

=for :man The four pieces
of data (keytag, algorithm, type, digest) should be in the same format they would
have in a zone file.

=item B<--hints>=FILE

Name of a root hints file to override the defaults.

=back

=head2 Cache Options

=over 4

=item B<--save>=FILE

Write the contents of the accumulated DNS packet cache to a file with the given name
after the testing suite has finished running.

=item B<--restore>=FILE

Prime the DNS packet cache with the contents from the file with the given name
before starting the testing suite.

=for :man The format of the file should be from one produced by the --save
switch.

=back

=head2 Deprecated Options

=over 4

=item B<--encoding>=ENCODING

Deprecated: Simply remove it from your usage. It is ignored.

=item B<--[no-]json-translate>

Deprecated since v2023.1, use --no-raw instead.

=for :man For streaming JSON output, include the translated message of the tag.

=back

=head2 Option Aliases

These options are provided for compatibility with older scripts.
The first two are aliases for C<--help>.
The rest are aliases for their namesakes spelled with dash C<-> instead of
underscore C<_>.

=over 4

=item B<-?>

=item B<--usage>

=head1 EXAMPLES

    zonemaster-cli zonemaster.net

    zonemaster-cli --test=delegation01 --level=debug zonemaster.net

    zonemaster-cli --list-tests

=head1 PROFILES

The testing and result analysis performed by Zonemaster Engine is always
guided by a profile.
Zonemaster Engine has a default profile with sensible defaults.
Zonemaster CLI allows users to override the default profile data with
values from a profile JSON file with the C<--profile> option.
For details on profiles and how they're respresented in files, see
L<Zonemaster::Engine::Profile>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

If there is a readable file F</etc/zonemaster/cli.args> (Linux style), each line
in that file will be prepended as an argument on the command line. If no
F</etc/zonemaster/cli.args> is found (or is not readable) but
F</usr/local/etc/zonemaster/cli.args> (FreeBSD style) is found and readable then
that file will be used instead. Only one global file is loaded.

If there is a readable file F<.zonemaster/cli.args> in the user's home
directory, it will be used in the same way even when a global file has been
loaded. Any argument in user's F<cli.args> will override the same argument in the
global config file.

For example, if one would like to by default run with the log
level set to DEBUG and with translation to human-readable messages turned off,
one could put this in the config file:

   --raw
   --level=DEBUG

Only one argument per line. If the argument has a value there must be a "="
between argument and value. A line starting with "#" is a comment. Comments
cannot be added on lines with arguments.

Any arguments actually given on the command line will override what is in any of
the loaded config files.
